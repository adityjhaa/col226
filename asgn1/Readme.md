## Assignment 1

### Part A: Specification

1. Specify the reflexive-transitive closure of a relation R over S  (R is a subset of S X S) in terms of membership.
2. Specify the reflexive-symmetric-transitive closure of a relation R over S  (R is a subset of S X S) in terms of membership.

### Part B: Implementation of Sets as Lists with no duplicates.

Consider  the following programs in PROLOG (these can help and/or guid you)

/*  del(X,L1,L2) -- delete element X from a list L1 to obtain L2 */ 

del(X, [ ] , [ ]) :- !.

del(X, [X|R], Z) :- del(X, R, Z), !.

del(X, [Y|R], [Y|Z]) :- del(X, R, Z), !.


/*  remdups(L, L1) remove duplicates from a list L to get L1 */

remdups([ ], [ ]) :- !.

remdups([X|R], [X|Z]) :- del(X, R, L), remdups(L, Z).


/* Assuming no duplicates in S1, S2 here is an implementation of union of S1, S2 */

unionI([ ], S2, S2) :- !.

unionI(S1, [ ], S1) :- !.

unionI([X|R], S2, [X|Z]) :- del(X, S2, S3),  unionI(R, S3, Z).

  

/* append(L1, L2, L3) -- append lis  L1 to list L2 to get list  L3 */

append( [ ], L, L).

append( [X|R], L, [X|Z]) :- append(R, L, Z).


/* mapcons(X,L1, L2) --  cons the element X to each list in L1 to get L2 */

mapcons(X, [ ], [ ]) :- !.

mapcons(X, [Y|R], [ [X|Y] | Z ]) :- mapcons(X, R, Z).


/* powerI( S, P1): Here is an implementation of powerset of S */

powerI([ ], [ [ ] ]) :- !.

powerI([X|R], P) :- powerI(R, P1),  mapcons(X, P1, P2), append(P2, P1, P).


1. Check with sufficient examples  that unionI and powerI indeed implement union and power.
2. Check that union does not have duplicates. 
3. Assuming no duplicates in lists representing S1 and S2, write a PROLOG program  interI(S1, S2, S3) that implements intersection of two finite sets.  
4. Assuming no duplicates in lists representing S1 and S2, write a PROLOG program  diffI(S1, S2, S3) that implements set-difference of two finite sets.
5. Assuming no duplicates in lists representing S1 and S2, write a PROLOG program  cartesianI(S1, S2, S3) that implements cartesian of two finite sets.
6. Provide sufficient test cases examples to demonstrate your implementations are correct.
7. Suggest a way to check that the powersets obtained from the implementation of two different valid representations of a set (elements given in different order) are equal.
