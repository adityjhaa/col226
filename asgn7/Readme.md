## Assignment 7

Consider the language you used for Assignment 6 or some extension thereof, and design and implement (in OCaml) the ***Krivine*** machine that implements Call-by-Name semantics. 

As usual, make whatever design choices you deem fit, and provide test cases which demonstrate that your implementations of the machine runs correctly.
